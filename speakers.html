                                        While women comprised 37% of computer science graduates in 1984, only 18% pursue the field today. Increasing the number of women who can code and specifically in the growing field of artificial intelligence, is critical. In this session, Laura Heisman, GitHub's VP of Communications will interview Fiona Tan, Senior Vice President of Customer Technology at Walmart Labs on why women are fundamental to the future of the self-learning algorithms that power A.I. and why closing the gender gap in STEM is not only important for business, but important for society.

                                        While women comprised 37% of computer science graduates in 1984, only 18% pursue the field today. Increasing the number of women who can code and specifically in the growing field of artificial intelligence, is critical. In this session, Laura Heisman, GitHub's VP of Communications will interview Fiona Tan, Senior Vice President of Customer Technology at Walmart Labs on why women are fundamental to the future of the self-learning algorithms that power A.I. and why closing the gender gap in STEM is not only important for business, but important for society.

Yes, the talks are highly technical, and no, the speakers aren't singing or dancing—but isn’t there a way to make these entertaining?<br><br>Armed with a theatre degree, a certificate from Hackbright, and all of the lines and lyrics of Legally Blonde the musical memorized, Chloe set out to make a community event that was not only informational, but entertaining, too.

                                        Modern microcontrollers make it easy to bring your code out of the digital world and into the physical. Learn how any software engineer can get started with microcontroller programming, beginning with the Particle Photon board, a wifi-enabled microcontroller. You already know how to code. Now you just need a basic understanding of circuits and familiarity with the latest tools. Let’s pick up our soldering irons and put on safety goggles—it’s time to make things.

                                        GitHub is more than a home for code. It’s a forum for collaboration, a sandbox for testing, a launchpad for deployment, and often, a platform for learning new skills. GitHub Learning Lab helps developer grow through active learning experiences without leaving GitHub. The app engages with students in issues and pull requests as they learn and guides them along their journey, responding to their activity and tracking their progress.<br><br>In this talk, we’ll share how we built Learning Lab using public GitHub APIs and Probot, a framework for building GitHub Apps. We’ll also share implementation details for reusable API abstractions - using these actions, you can build your own courses on Learning Lab to teach developers how you work, what your product or integration does, or something completely new.

                                        One of the greatest advantages for leaders in AI innovation comes from the ability to quickly bring cutting-edge research to large-scale production. Earlier this year, Facebook announced the roadmap for PyTorch 1.0. Continuing in the open source spirit of its predecessors, PyTorch 1.0 is being developed completely in the open with contributors from major academic and industry research institutes, utilizing open source platforms and tools such as GitHub, Jenkins, Conda, and Python PIP. PyTorch 1.0 combines the scalability of Caffe2 with PyTorch’s flexible front end to create a multi-faceted deep learning system that delivers an accelerated end-to-end research-to-production experience. Come learn about PyTorch 1.0, and how it can help you embed AI into your workflow with strong GitHub community support.

                                        In music, a mashup is a song created by blending two or more existing songs into a whole new piece. The best mashups are seamless and natural. They’re just good songs.<br><br>In today’s golden age of APIs, nobody would be surprised if you used more than six APIs in a project. But, like songs, they all work slightly differently. You also have to remember which data is located in which API and what fields indicate a foreign key to another API.<br><br>What we need are API mashups. By stitching together multiple GraphQL schemas we can take away the overhead of having to remember where data is located and how to resolve references between them. In this talk, you’ll learn how to use schema stitching to annotate the GitHub API with metadata about the repositories and users in an organization, resulting in a more powerful API that’s ready to build great tooling with less effort.

At its heart, infrastructure exists to solve peoples' problems. The key to choosing the right tools is seeing infrastructure for what it is: A product used by people.<br><br>This talk presents the story of Moda—GitHub's internal service platform. Moda is a set of tools, practices, and ideas for running software on Kubernetes. We’ll share how we approached big infrastructure changes, what has worked well, and why we made the decisions we did. Our success is rooted in treating infrastructure like a product, remembering that we build tools to enable other developers, and focusing on what can help them build the future of software.<br><br>This talk is about the big picture, not the day-to-day details, so you won’t need prior knowledge of containers or Kubernetes to participate or benefit.

                                        What if your "Hello World" project could have an impact on the real world? What if your first code could control a structure like the ARCH?<br><br>Sponsored by Mozilla for close to 2,000 attendees at GitHub Universe 2018, the ARCH Light Art Installation is the first truly immersive "code expressed into art" experience.  Anyone can contribute to this interactive, multi-sensory installation—the first of its kind to visualize the power of JavaScript and WebAssembly as animation with over 30,000 colored LEDs.<br><br>In this talk, we’ll start with the narrative of collaboration with experiential artist Ian Brill who created the ARCH piece and progress into how code can express 3D Space (perhaps 4D if you include time) in computing power. Then we’ll dive into why this structure is a good mental model for how WebAssembly and JavaScript work together through something called linear memory.

                                        Continuous Integration (CI) is a software practice that requires frequently committing code to a shared repository. When you commit code more often, it can raise errors much sooner which is why this talk will introduce you to how you can leverage the new Checks API alongside your CI to improve your development workflow and reducing the amount of cognitive load code a developer needs for debugging to find the source of the error.

With some workflow and policy adjustments, you can bring open source to your organization to see increases in collaboration and product quality.<br><br>In this panel, you’ll hear real-life examples from Comcast, Oracle, and Zalando about how their teams have navigated red tape, encouraged innovation, and taken products to the next level on their journey to open source adoption.

                                        Open source security management, licensing compliance, and quality assessment, are becoming essential for developers working to build software faster. Developers are required to validate the security of open source components they use, and importantly, prioritize how they handle actual security vulnerabilities, enabling a significant reduction of security vulnerability risk while maintaining productivity. On average, more than 80 percent of reported security vulnerabilities in open source libraries are not referenced by the developers’ code, but there's little visibility between the two.<br><br>In this session, you'll learn how functions such as vulnerability discovery and impact analysis can help developers focus on real security risks that affect their applications, pinpointing the calls to vulnerable code, down to the pertinent filename and line number. You'll also see how to use security checks in GitHub to tap into the normal SDLC working environment with integrations like the Checks API.

                                        The pillars of observability have long been accepted as key components of any microservice-in-production. But what about those new products—those new features—that have yet to be released? Properly instrumenting and leveraging metrics at this stage is perhaps even more crucial. When a product is yet to be released, identifying and addressing early bugs is critical.<br><br>See how the team at Digital Ocean leveraged Prometheus to properly instrument and test features within their software-defined networking pillar. This session will highlight instrumentation, key visualizations, and takeaways from their experience. You’ll also hear about areas for improvement and find out how to use these learnings for your own releases.

                                        In 2013, a number of employees at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory believed the tools that were so successfully supporting open source software could support development at JPL, too. Core to this belief was the theory that software development teams at JPL operated similarly to the open source community.<br><br>Known as innersource, this theory has been put into practice in a number of companies. Learn why JPL cares about innersource, how they champion open source development principles on GitHub Enterprise, and what progress they’ve made so far.

We'll examine the anonymized, aggregate data from millions of builds for best practices on commits, pull requests, disaster recovery, frequency of deploy, and more.

                                        Developer tools can be an efficiency multiplier, but tools only help when you actually use them. It's also tough to balance time between "learning to use your tools better" and "getting things done." Get an introduction to the psychology of making habits stick and hear about some lesser-known yet powerful features of Atom, the hackable text editor. From real-time collaborative text editing to built-in Git integration, there's a lot you might not know your editor can do.

With more than one million businesses serviced through their brands, the hopes for creating the bank of the future is firmly locked in the sights of this digitally transforming organization.<br><br>In order to hit their ambitious goal, Lloyds Banking Group is changing from a traditionally introverted bank, hardened to risk through years of manual process, into an open and collaborative organization where innovation and experimentation are driven by engineering and automation.<br><br>During this talk you’ll learn how Lloyds Banking Group journeyed into innersource with the formation of engineering guilds and how this lead to the adoption of GitHub Enterprise from proof of concept to widespread use. We’ll also explore how engineering guilds formed the GitHub Enterprise Working Group to share successes and educate on best practices, while safeguarding the operation of their engineering community.<br><br>Finally, we’ll tell the story of how Lloyds Banking Group is moving fast toward open source, powered by the determination and ambition of engineers—and how GitHub Solutions Engineers are mentoring this enthusiasm to give back to the community.

                                        Airbnb has grown exponentially over the last few years—and so has their codebase. Most of Airbnb's code lives in a monolithic Rails application called Monorail. Despite having hundreds of contributors, the team is still able to ship fast and frequently. Hear some of the unique challenges Airbnb faces as their engineering team grows and see how they plan to transition toward a service-oriented architecture—a multi-year effort involving hundreds of engineers across the company.

                                        In today’s news, technology and software are often maligned with stories of how technology is driving bias to eroding democracies to isolating communities. At the same time, the social problems we see in the world (climate change, poverty, etc.) are ever pervasive and persistent. Open source software can be an effective tool to address these pressing social issues of our time. It offers an even more compelling opportunity to develop and collaborate on software that is changing people’s lives. Come listen to developers who are working at the intersection of social change and technology. From the Gates Foundation’s work in expanding financial services to the world’s poor through open source to the Human Utility project’s efforts to address poverty in Detroit with software to Optikey’s revolutionary technology to help people with disabilities communicate, there is no shortage of opportunities for technology to do good in this world.

                                        The social sector is often left behind in the race for technology. Open source can offer a way for social change actors like foundations, governments, nonprofits and educational institutions to create useful, open source tools that can unlock innovation and achieve their goals. Come learn how the Case Foundation and an XPRIZE Finalist are developing code and software to address social issues in the world around. They will share their challenges, opportunities and benefits that open source offers for social change actors.

                                        Independently, the Visual Studio Code team at Microsoft and the editor tools team at GitHub began exploring the possibility of an integration between their two products. The team at Microsoft started to design a pull request experience within Visual Studio Code, while the GitHub team prototyped one modeled after the same experience in the Visual Studio IDE. By chance, the two teams met and showed each other nearly identical prototypes. The coincidence sparked the collaboration that brought you an integrated GitHub experience in Visual Studio Code supported by the Visual Studio Code API.<br><br>In this session, you’ll get an overview of how two companies worked together to support collaborative and open source development. You’ll also hear about the latest features and learn how you can contribute.

                                        Independently, the Visual Studio Code team at Microsoft and the editor tools team at GitHub began exploring the possibility of an integration between their two products. The team at Microsoft started to design a pull request experience within Visual Studio Code, while the GitHub team prototyped one modeled after the same experience in the Visual Studio IDE. By chance, the two teams met and showed each other nearly identical prototypes. The coincidence sparked the collaboration that brought you an integrated GitHub experience in Visual Studio Code supported by the Visual Studio Code API.<br><br>In this session, you’ll get an overview of how two companies worked together to support collaborative and open source development. You’ll also hear about the latest features and learn how you can contribute.

                                        When working on larger software projects—like autonomous driving or complex embedded controller logics—you’ll eventually need to decide how to organize your code base. Whether you choose multiple Git repositories or a mono repo, you’ll have to deal with both pros and cons. Even if it’s the cleaner solution from a configuration management perspective, the additional complexity of handling a multi-repository setup often rules it out.<br><br>The team at Continental recently switched from a mono to a multi-repository approach because of our code base’s requirements for embedded development. They have to deal with strongly dependent and optimized code while supporting many variants in product configuration.<br><br>With MegaMerger, Continental solved the issue of delivering change sets that are spread across multiple repositories and can be built, tested, and merged as part of an automatic transaction. Their goal was to apply the pull request model to repositories that are connected with submodules or a repository configuration. Their GitHub App controls and synchronizes multiple pull requests without imposing any special requirements on the underlying build system to obtain the change set.<br><br>Get an introduction to the given automotive embedded environment that lead to Continental’s decision, along with the workflow schema and the design decision implemented in the MegaMerger toolset. You’ll also see what limitations the team is facing, learn how to deal with distributed code bases, and see what’s possible when integrating with GitHub.

                                        Just as GitHub empowers developers to collaborate more effectively on code, GraphQL empowers developers to collaborate more effectively on APIs. Since Facebook open-sourced the technology in 2015, GraphQL has taken the industry by storm and GraphQL APIs are in production or underway at enterprise, media, and tech companies alike, including Github. Apollo has been driving the future of GraphQL and the app development workflow, enabling a thriving open source community on Github and building integrations between GraphQL and other developer tools.<br><br>Taking inspiration from GitHub's approach to code collaboration, we wanted to build a tool for collaborating on GraphQL APIs in a similar way. We landed on a feature for recommending, implementing, and approving changes to GraphQL schemas, which developers can hook directly into CI! Along with other tools offered by the GitHub developer platform, we used the GitHub Checks API to build this feature out, just days after its announcement.<br><br>In this talk, we'll dive into the software collaboration space and take a look at how teams collaborate on building and consuming APIs via GitHub today. We'll take a look at the nuts and bolts of how we've used the GitHub platform and the Checks API to enhance this collaboration with an API management and collaboration tool. Finally, we'll explore the next steps for expanding GitHub and Apollo's shared vision of enhancing software collaboration. Throughout the talk, I plan on using the GitHub GraphQL API itself as our prototypical example to tie the story together.

                                        In today’s news, technology and software are often maligned with stories of how technology is driving bias to eroding democracies to isolating communities. At the same time, the social problems we see in the world (climate change, poverty, etc.) are ever pervasive and persistent. Open source software can be an effective tool to address these pressing social issues of our time. It offers an even more compelling opportunity to develop and collaborate on software that is changing people’s lives. Come listen to developers who are working at the intersection of social change and technology. From the Gates Foundation’s work in expanding financial services to the world’s poor through open source to the Human Utility project’s efforts to address poverty in Detroit with software to Optikey’s revolutionary technology to help people with disabilities communicate, there is no shortage of opportunities for technology to do good in this world.

                                        In today’s news, technology and software are often maligned with stories of how technology is driving bias to eroding democracies to isolating communities. At the same time, the social problems we see in the world (climate change, poverty, etc.) are ever pervasive and persistent. Open source software can be an effective tool to address these pressing social issues of our time. It offers an even more compelling opportunity to develop and collaborate on software that is changing people’s lives. Come listen to developers who are working at the intersection of social change and technology. From the Gates Foundation’s work in expanding financial services to the world’s poor through open source to the Human Utility project’s efforts to address poverty in Detroit with software to Optikey’s revolutionary technology to help people with disabilities communicate, there is no shortage of opportunities for technology to do good in this world.

                                        In today’s news, technology and software are often maligned with stories of how technology is driving bias to eroding democracies to isolating communities. At the same time, the social problems we see in the world (climate change, poverty, etc.) are ever pervasive and persistent. Open source software can be an effective tool to address these pressing social issues of our time. It offers an even more compelling opportunity to develop and collaborate on software that is changing people’s lives. Come listen to developers who are working at the intersection of social change and technology. From the Gates Foundation’s work in expanding financial services to the world’s poor through open source to the Human Utility project’s efforts to address poverty in Detroit with software to Optikey’s revolutionary technology to help people with disabilities communicate, there is no shortage of opportunities for technology to do good in this world.

                                        Azure Pipelines is Microsoft’s new fully-managed CI/CD service and it’s free for open source projects and supports any language or framework. In this demo-heavy session, you'll learn how to build your open source projects using Azure Pipeline’s Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using our cloud-hosted Windows, Linux and Mac build agents. We’ll also explore how to deploy to Azure or any cloud using the same service.

                                        What's the right size for a repository? When's the right time to migrate from a centralized version control system? How much of my history should I keep? If you've asked these questions, you're not alone. Moving from legacy systems introduces challenges for organizations of any size.

                                        Maintaining an open source project means you're often coding less and supporting contributors more—and taking on a set of tasks that maintainers rarely plan for. For some, this leads to burnout rather than thriving projects.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        This workshop brings you experienced project maintainers who are ready to discuss the documentation, processes, and hard questions that need to be answered when preparing a project. Most importantly, you'll learn how to create a healthy community that helps move your project forward while safeguarding your sanity.
                                    </p>

                                        Whether you're interested in building a special feature for your team or just automating some tasks, Probot is one way to quickly turn ideas into innovations.

                                        This beginner-friendly workshop doesn't require any GitHub Apps experience or prior knowledge. We’ll teach you who, what, where, when, and why they’re important. And you’ll walk away with skills for building, customizing, and even integrating improvements across every project you touch.
                                    </p>

                                        GitHub's API covers just about everything you see and do on GitHub. Integrations have the power to go far beyond setting a commit status or responding to a pull request.

                                        In this workshop, you'll learn how others have built powerful integrations using the GitHub API and how you can create a smooth experience for developers with tightly-woven integrations.

                                        If you care about giving back to communities and the quality of your open source code, consider the impact your organization could have if every member contributed to open source projects they use. The transition from using open source to contributing isn't always easy, but it's important to give back.

                                        Vulnerabilities that put data or finances at risk are any developer's worst nightmare. But abuse vectors that lead to customers being harassed, doxxed, traumatized, or threatened are just as important to a community's experience—and are often neglected.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        This workshop will introduce programmers of all skill levels to common ways that web applications can be exploited to harm others and some options for addressing them. We'll look at examples of software from pop culture with abuse vectors and collaborate on possible solutions.

                                        Maintaining an open source project means you're often coding less and supporting contributors more—and taking on a set of tasks that maintainers rarely plan for. For some, this leads to burnout rather than thriving projects.

Most importantly, you'll learn how to create a healthy community that helps move your project forward while safeguarding your sanity.
